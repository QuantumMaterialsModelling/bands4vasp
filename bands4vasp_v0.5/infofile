Options:
  --help                  Display this information.
  --info                  The same as --help.
  --inpar                 copy the default INPAR file to your current directory.
  --fermi [file]          make a fermisurface calculation.
  --pre-[options]         preparing VASP calculations, by copying a folder with
                          prepared VASP files and changing the KPOINTS file,
                          depending on the type of calculations specified by
                          the following options:

  --pre-lines $1 $2       prepare line calculations for each pair of k-points in
                          KPOINTS file after the flag '#makepath'.
                          $1 = directory for the prepared VASP files
                          $2 = name for the multidirectory
  --pre-circle $1 $2 $3   prepare radial centered line calculations given by the
                          coordinates in the KPOINTS file after the flag '#makepath'.
                          There should be 3 points:
                          1.The first point is the center of the circle
                          2.The second point is the start point
                          3.The third point is the end point
                          It calculates the points along the circle in
                          a mathematically positv sense.
                          The calculation will be done as a line from
                          the given center to each calculated point.
                          $1 = directory for the prepared VASP files
                          $2 = number of equidistant points on the circle
                          $3 = name for the multidirectory
  --pre-surface $1 $2 $3  prepare equidistant line calculations with a rectangle defined
                          by the coordinates given in the KPOINTS file after the flag '#makepath'.
                          There should be 3 points:
                          1.The first corner of the rectangle where the calculation starts
                          2.The second corner of the rectangle, which defines the path
                            of the line calculations
                          3.The third corner of the surface, which defines
                            the translation direction of the lines
                          $1 = directory for the prepared VASP files
                          $2 = number of equidistant lines on the surface
                          $3 = name for the multidirectory


Passing files:
 There are 3 ways to pass files to bands4vasp
  
 -Single path:   If you only have one path of calculation data you can go eather in the directory
                 and just execute bands4vasp or you can pass the directory in which the data are stored.
                 => b4vasp "directory"

 -Multi path:    If you have more than one path (e.g. Fermisurface) you should named it equaly dispite
                 a number in the name, or simply use the --pre options of bands4vasp. You can start
                 the multipath calculation by passing a %-sign as a placeholder for numbers. If we have:
                 "1line 2line 3line 4line 5line 6line 7line ..." we can simply enter:
                 => b4vasp %line
                
 -Fermisurface:  For a Fermisurface you pass the multi path structure with a %-sign as discribed befor.
                 You only add the option --fermi to the command:
                 => b4vasp --fermi %line
